# AntabGMVA

<b>"That is a very comfortable way to manage ANTAB files"</b><br>
&mdash;Alan Roy (MPIfR), 2024

The so-called ANTAB files will be sent to Principle Investigators (PIs) of Global mm-VLBI Array ([GMVA](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/vlbi/globalmm/)) observations. The ANTAB files contain lots of metadata such as the system temperature (Tsys) that was measured/monitored by each of the GMVA antenna stations during the observations. The Tsys measurements are essential in the amplitude calibration of GMVA data to generate science-ready data products. But unfortunately, the metadata are not complete and there are almost always erroneous values in them.

This Python program allows GMVA users to 

Four Advantages
* AIPS/CASA(rPICARD)-readable format
* Erroneous Tsys values
* Overview/expectation about the data
* Create the convenient All-in-One ANTAB file


## Installation
The latest version is v24.813. Install it via `pip`.
```
$ pip install antabgmva
```
If the installation was successful, `antabgmva` should be in the list:
```
$ pip list
```

Requirements
* `Python3.x`: v3.8 and v3.12 checked, but the lower versions of `Python3` should also be fine.
* `Numpy`
* `Matplotlib`
* `Scipy`

Others
* It is recommended to use the `IPython` interface (v7.x and v8.x checked).
* Not all the matplotlib backends were checked, but `Qt5Agg` and `tkagg` checked.




## How to Use?
A complete Manual/Tutorial pdf file is at [tutorial/AntabGMVA_tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/greendw/AntabGMVA/blob/main/tutorial/AntabGMVA_tutorial.pdf).

This program is very easy to use. Example datasets for the tutorial are at [examples/](https://github.com/greendw/AntabGMVA/tree/main/examples).

For GMVA metadata Query
* ...@...

GMVA data are processed by the MPIfR correlator in Bonn, Germany. Then the correlation team will send the processed GMVA data (FITS-IDI) to PIs with the metadata (ANTAB, WX, etc.).
