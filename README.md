# AntabGMVA

<b>"That is a very comfortable way to manage ANTAB files"</b><br>
_&ensp;- Alan Roy (MPIfR), 2024_

Principle Investigators (PIs) of Global mm-VLBI Array ([GMVA](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/vlbi/globalmm/)) observations will receive the so-called ANTAB files. The ANTAB files contain lots of metadata such as the system temperature (Tsys) that was measured/monitored by each of the GMVA antenna stations during the observations. The Tsys measurements are essential in the amplitude calibration of GMVA data to generate science-ready data products. But unfortunately, the metadata are not complete and there are almost always erroneous values in them.

AntabGMVA is a Python program that allows GMVA users to manage the GMVA ANTAB files easily.

## Why it is useful
* Convert some of the unusual ANTAB formats into the AIPS/CASA(rPICARD)-readable format
* Replace erroneous Tsys values with reasonable values by using linear interpolation
* Create the convenient All-in-One ANTAB file instead of carrying all those individual data files
* Get an overview/expectation about the individual antennas of your GMVA data (i.e., data quality)


## Installation
The latest version is v24.813. Install it via `pip`.
```
$ pip install antabgmva
```
If the installation was successful, `antabgmva` should be in the list:
```
$ pip list
```

Requirements
* `Python3.x`: v3.8 and v3.12 checked, but the lower versions of `Python3` should also be fine.
* `Numpy`
* `Matplotlib`
* `Scipy`

Others
* It is recommended to use the `IPython` interface (v7.x and v8.x checked).
* It is highly recommended to run this program in terminal rather than `Jupyter` through a web browser.
* Not all the matplotlib backends were checked, but it works with `Qt5Agg` and `tkagg`.




## How to Use?
A complete Manual/Tutorial pdf file is at [tutorial/AntabGMVA_tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/greendw/AntabGMVA/blob/main/tutorial/AntabGMVA_tutorial.pdf).

This program is very easy to use. Example datasets for the tutorial are at [examples/](https://github.com/greendw/AntabGMVA/tree/main/examples).

For GMVA metadata Query
* TBD@TBD

GMVA data are processed by the MPIfR correlator in Bonn, Germany. Then the correlation team will send the processed GMVA data (FITS-IDI) to PIs with the metadata (ANTAB, WX, etc.).

* Web-based Jupyter notebook may return empty .png files (thus run it in terminal).
* Be careful of the column indices/delimeters in GLT ANTABs (they may change with different epoch).
* For the GLT 'c221c' ANTAB file (GMVA 22A; observed in April 2022), modify the raw data as follow.

 ```
 awk 'BEGIN {FS=";" ;OFS="  "} {print $3,$6}' raw.csv > out1
    awk 'NR>1 {print}' out1 > out2
&ensp;&ensp; sed 's/2022-04-03/093 /' out2 > out3
 ***Then, use this 'out3' for AntabGMVA in Python.***
